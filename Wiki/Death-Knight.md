**Death Knight** is a new character class added in this mod adapted from the World of Warcraft class of the same name. I was inspired to create this by [VivaSortiara](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/187617384)'s [Death Knight Class](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1725) mod. I liked some of their ideas but personally wanted a version that was changed more significantly from WoW to more match the mechanics and vibes of BG3 / DnD 5e Classes. This included things like not having a 0-100 resource like Runic Power, not having direct percantage proc chances, using actual BG3 art style for all the icons, incorporating existing 5e spells, 

The end result is a Martial class that can utilize it's unique
