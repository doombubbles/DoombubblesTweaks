### Other Mods Changes

These changes will apply to other mods if you have DoombubblesTweaks below them in the Mod Manager load order.

#### Cleric Subclasses

Arcane Domain now gets Counterspell instead of Dispel Magic as a domain spell

#### Artificer

Arcane Firearm changed to {{ get .loca "h3a5390c0gc1c0g4ebeg851fg634bb80d803c" | quote }}

This makes the effect actually passive and actually apply well to AOE spells.
