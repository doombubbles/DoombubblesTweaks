### New "Downcast" Effects

Many spells now have "cantrip versions" in the way that Create Water used to (and now does again). That is, a weaker version of a spell that is "downcasted" to the power of a cantrip, costing no spell slots. Each one become available once you're first capable of upcasting the spell.
