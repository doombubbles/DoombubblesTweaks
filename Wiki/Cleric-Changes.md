### War Domain

- War Priest Extra Attack is now toggleable when it triggers to make sure it never interferes with Extra Attack
- Now chooses a Fighting Style at Level 3 from the same list as Paladins
- Gains "Improved War Priest" at level 5 making War Priest Charges replenish on a Short or Long Rest
- (EXPERIMENTAL) Now gains Extra Attack at level 6

These are powerful buffs, but they still don't even reach the level of base Swords Bard so it seems ok

### Trickery Domain

- Blessing of the Trickster no longer requires concentration
- Invoke Duplicity no longer requires concentration
