# Doombubbles' Randomized Equipment Loot Mod

## Changes to base REL

- Traders no longer offer unique magical items
- Removed all the extraneous 2% chance sources of magical items added
- Almost all item sources now have a 33% chance at rolling a bonus item of the same rarity
- Fixed some stray ascii control characters interfering with a few items showing up like the Pearl of Power Amulet or the Ring of Mind Shielding
- Removed some non-unique weapons from the table like Merregon Halberd
- Item Rarity Changes
	- Arcane Acuity helmets all to Very Rare
	- Luminous Armour to Very Rare
	- Band of the Mystic Scoundrel to Very Rare
	- All items with rarities changed by Honour mode now use that rarity for placement, rather than some using it and some not
- Removed items that are still in the world:
	- Blood of Lathander
	- Phalar Aluve
	- Orphic Hammer
	- Sentient Amulet
	- Sword of the Emperor
