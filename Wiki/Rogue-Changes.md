- (EXPERIMENTAL) Now gains Extra Attack at Level 6
- Reliable Talent at level 11 now also makes the minimum result you can roll on damage die be 3

(Because seriously, I haven't seen a single build that ever recommends more than 4 levels of Rogue)

### Arcane Trickster

- Mage Hand no longer has a cooldown
<!-- - Mage Hand Legerdemain invisibility now behaves like Greater Invisibility, and Mage Hands passively gain Pass Without A Trace -->
- Magical Ambush now also lets Sneak Attack be added as a reaction to Spell Attack damage
- (EXPERIMENTAL) Magical Ambush and Mage Hand Legerdemain have swapped places, to be in line with other Rogue subclasses getting their combat benefit at level 3 and their utility benefit at level 9
<!-- - ~~Now gains spell slots like a half caster instead of a third caster~~
  - ~~Still chooses specifically Illusion and Enchantment spells at most levels~~ -->

### Swashbuckler

- Now gains proficiency with Scimitars
- Dirty Trick: Flick o' the Wrist can now be used on enemies even if they don't have weapons to disarm
