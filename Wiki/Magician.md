Experimental Class that's a copy of Sorcerer but with Wizard style spell learning (scrolls included) and using Intelligence as its casting ability. 
All class features that would use Charisma for a Sorcerer will use Intelligence for a Magician.

For dialogue purposes, Magicians are tagged as both Sorcerers and Wizards.

For ease of use, Sorcery Points have not been renamed for them.
