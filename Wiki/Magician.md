Experimental Class that's a copy of Sorcerer but with Wizard style spell learning (scrolls included) and using Intelligence as its casting ability. 
All class features that would use Charisma for a Sorcerer will use Intelligence for a Magician.
Magicians learn half as many spells through leveling up as Wizards do.

For dialogue purposes, Magicians are tagged as both Sorcerers and Wizards.

For ease of use, Sorcery Points have not been renamed for them.
