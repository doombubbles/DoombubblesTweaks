# DoombubblesTweaks


## Highlights

New classes and subclasses inspired from World of Warcraft, like Fire/Frost/Arcane Wizard, Oath of Retribution Paladin, and the WIP Death Knight class!

Buffs to unpopular subclasses like Valour Bard, Conjuration/Illusion/Enchantment/Transmutation Wizard, Four Elements Monk, Rogues, etc.

Dozens of new items and item combinations that unlock new builds.

Downcast many spells into cantrips versions that consume no spell slots, and upcast many cantrips to consume spell slots for more damage.

Dozens of item changes that improve quality of life and unlock more variety, including more Markoheshkir Elemental attunements!

Reworks of single day unique buffs to make them permanent but weaker.
